# Web Technologies II Project

This project was created for the course CS441: Web Technologies II for the Fall 2020 semester.

## Description

This project is a full-stack web application. The front-end is built using React while the back-end is being handled by Node and Express. Except for the following tasks, everything else has been done:

-Photos 40px x 40px can be optional and better to use public image URLs.
-Edit takes you to the page with all the record from database loaded in a form.

## How To Run

Open a terminal/command prompt window and navigate to ./web-project/backend.

Then use the following commands to start the back-end server:

`npm install`
`npm start`

Once the back-end is up and running, navigate to ./web-project and re-enter these commands:

`npm install`
`npm start`

The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
